    <h2>Software Engineer / Product Manager</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I enjoy creative problem-solving, efficiency, and self-empowerment. My most rewarding tasks are those that 
      help people and organizations improve, usually by providing a better understanding of the tools of the modern age. 
      Four years ago I began learning how to code. It started as a way to grow
      our business, MyTennisLessons.com, but has turned into a passion and craft that I'm proud to be participating in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently available for part-time and fixed-scope projects. I specialize in helping businesses find cost-effective
      solutions for real-world problems. I truly enjoy using the experience that I've had growing our own business, to help
      other businesses succeed, without breaking the bank on a full-time engineering team. Contact me to start a conversation today.

    <h2>MyTennisLessons and FitnessTrainer Experience</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Full-stack, multi-site management</h3> 
    <p>
      For 5 years I've helped guide and build the foundations for the MyTennisLessons and Fitnesstrainer platforms. 
      From building our first sales CRM to hacking at experimental features, I've had the pleasure of working on just about every 
      aspect of our technology stack. Currently I serve as the lead developer, managing our shared codebases and coordinating 
      new projects. In the past I've served in a variety of roles, from the first sales person, to sales engineer, to product manager working with overseas
      contractors. I love being able to touch so many different parts of the business, and finding ways to improve the effeciency
      of our marketing, sales, and operations teams. And of course finding ways to make our user's experience the best-in-class.
    </p>

    <h3>E-commerce solutions</h3>
    <p>
      Payments for both of our sites are processed using a Braintree custom integration. Clients can add payment methods,
      purchase packages for coaches, and monitor their order status. Providers receive notifications about new bookings
      and can use credits from the purchase to schedule lessons. Our system also monitors and tracks providers receiving payment
      for lessons.
    </p>

    <h3>Recurring billing and scheduling</h3>
    <p>
      In fall 2015, we made the biggest change to our scheduling platform, allowing for providers
      to setup recurring payments and charge clients on a per-lesson basis. This involved a significant 
      re-engineering of our upfront order-based system, which was inspired by the APIs of services
      like Chargify and Recurrly.
    </p>

    <h3>Salesforce integrations</h3>
    <p>
      Salesforce is one of the most powerful pieces of the MyTennisLessons/FitnessTrainer platform, and is 
      a critical piece for any medium-large sized business. Our Salesforce integration lets our team stay on top
      of potential clients, track instructor applications, and provides a data-hub for a lot of our marketing integrations.
      In 2015 we integrated with Heroku Connect, making our Salesforce integration incredibly easy to manage and allowing our 
      Salesforce data to become a powerful tool for new data-driven applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom SEO engine</h3>
    <p>
      In 2013 we switched to a rails driven seo page generator. Important things to consider when building
      an SEO generator are defaults and overrides for content and seo tags, CDN caching for maximum performance,
      and ease-of-use by end users. Creating new pages and changing content shouldn't take developer time. Today our SEO
      engine generates tens of thousands of pages for both MyTennisLessons and FitnessTrainer, allowing us to easily
      expand our nationwide network and launch new markets, with no additional development required.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic geo-search results</h3>
    <p>
      One of the core features of both MyTennisLessons and FitnessTrainer is the ability to find a coach near you. We
      use Algolia to index all of our service-providers and deliver an quick and responsive search experience. The initial
      implementation was set in place by our Lead Developer from 2013-2015, Luke Wendling, but since then I've used the framework
      we built to power email campaigns, custom recommendation pages, and admin-search interfaces. Most recently I implemented a 
      custom node script that can be used in Zapier to find the closest 3 providers, which can then be used in marketing emails.
    </p>

    <h3>Lead generation and drip campaigns</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges we've faced is building dynamic drip campaigns that factor in the user's actions on the website,
      sales person's interactions with the user, and the lifecycle stage of users in our signup process, either as a provider or client.
    </p>

    <h3>Email marketing solutions</h3>
    <p>
      Over the course of five years, email has played an important role in growing our sports
      network. I've implemented solutions ranging from custom Rails drip mailers, Customer.io, 
      Mailchimp, Hubspot, and Act-On to try and find the perfect balance of ease-of-access by marketing end-users
      and effective segment targeting. Today I'm happy to say we've found our best balance yet by using
      SendWithUs for amazingly easy to access templates that work for in-app emails, drip campaigns, and marketing blasts. 
      This lets us change, test, and grow our email templates without costly code changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Admin user interfaces</h3>
    <p>
      I've spoken with many people over the years looking to setup or running a marketplace, and 
      almost always I have to remind people about one of the most important users of the system..Admins.
      A lot of focus when building a system goes into the service provider and recipient user's experiences.
      But invariably any marketplace service is going to have to play some sort of role in-between these two sides
      of the service. Making sure that admin users can easily access important user data, see reports to understand the
      health of the business, and provide quick and efficient support means that you can provide a best-in-class service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our admin interfaces are custom built using ActiveAdmin, a delightful gem that makes simple, but powerful
      admin interfaces a breeze to build. More and more though I've been pushing functionality into saleforce using custom webhooks
      and Zapier.  
    </p>


    <h2>Other Professional Experience</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>EmberScreencasts</h3>
    <p>
      This year I started helping our first lead developer Jeffrey Biles with his latest website, Emberscreencasts.com. 
      My primary role in the project was to manage the design and front-end development process and create a custom integration
      with Stripe. After completing the project, I'm a huge fan of Stripe's API and look forward to using it again on a project.
      Next up is a search page, powered by Algolia's new Instantsearch.js library.
    </p>

    <h3>ZenFit Martial Arts</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to being an active member of the ZenFit gym, I've also recently started helping the business grow
      by adopting more effecient business technology. The first solution I've setup for them is an online sign-up for
      kids camps, taking advantage of Braintree's first $50K free of fees offer. The next project in the works is a student
      portal for managing membership and providing additional resources for current students. I also teach kids classes and 
      camps occassionally, which is always a fun time!
    </p>

    <h3>NationaField</h3>
    <p>
      In 2008 I worked for a political start-up NationalField, after spending a month working on the Obama Campaign 
      for Northwestern University. It was my first introduction to a startup environment and taught me alot about how
      the entreprenurial world works.
    </p>

    <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Hapkido / ZenFit</h3>
    <p>
      I've practiced the Korean martial arts of Hapkido for 6 years, 4 in High School and 2 in Austin, TX. It's had a 
      tremendous influence on my discipline, and I try to incorporate aspects into my daily and professional life as often 
      as a can. Currently I train at ZenFit in Austin, TX and enjoy the traditional approach to the art that they teach. Next up
      is Jiu-Jitsu..  
    </p>

    <h3>Star Citizen</h3>
    <p>
      Video games have always been an important part of my life. I began playing them at a young age with my Dad, and even wrote a 
      senior thesis <i>History as a Loaded Gun: American Exceptionalism in World War II First-Person Shooters</i> on the topic. My latest
      video game enthusiasm is the kickstarter based <i>Star Citizen</i>. The game has raised over $113 million in crowd-funding and promises
      an unprecendents open-galaxy approach. Amazingly the game has been playable throughout active development for over three years. When I'm not
      coding, practicing martial arts, or exploring Austin with friends, you can find me hanging out in a star ship somewhere outside the Crusader planetary
      system.
    </p>

    <h3>Heidi Klum</h3>
    <p>
      On Christmas Day of 2011, our two founders Andrew Marcus and Jesse Silkoff met with a random vehicle in a ____ parking lot
      and picked up a 9-month old boxer puppy. Her name had already been given by Austin Boxer Rescue, Heidi Klum. Since that fortituous day
      she has been our inspiration, our muse, our HR, and our love. Would this company of 5 dudes living and working in a house together
      have worked without her? Who knows. But I think one thing we all know... #itsall4klum
